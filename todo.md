- [*] infix to postfix with function parsing
- [*] Construct Expression tree

- [ ] Create interface for representing functions as `fox` ("f of x") structs
    - [ ] evaluate expression at x

- [ ] Create linear interpolation function


ONLY evaluate expression, will use linear interpolation instead of inverse function for simplicity.
